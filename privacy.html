      This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from this web store (the “Site”). 
      
      Personal Information We Collect 
      
      When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”. 
      
      We collect Device Information using the following technologies: 
      
      - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. 
      
      - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. 
      
      - “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site. 
      
      -Information contained within and relating to communications between you and the Site, including but not limited to emails, texts, and phone calls.
      
      -Other web and/or mobile technology tracking that may become available to us for the purposes of marketing the Site, the products on the Site, or for marketing research and development.
      
      Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, or opt-in to receiving certain information from us for marketing or promotional purposes, we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers, paypal information, Amazon pay, Apple Pay, and other payment processor related data), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order Information”. 
      
      We also may collect information from you specifically for the purposes of marketing and promotions, we refer to this information as “Marketing Information.”
      
      When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information, Order Information, and Marketing Information. For the avoidance of doubt, any of the Personal Information collected from you may be used for certain marketing purposes. We use the Order Information that we collect generally to help you transact on the site, and to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to: Agree that when you provide your email address and/or mobile phone number in the Site’s checkout process, that we may contact you at such email address or phone number to remind you to finish your order if it is not yet complete, or for us to send you any other information related to your order. I would be surprised if you read all of this, thanks for reading and making it to the end of the page. Anyways blah blah blah, :) </p>
